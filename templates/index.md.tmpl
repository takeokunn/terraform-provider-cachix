# Cachix Provider

The Cachix provider allows you to manage [Cachix](https://cachix.org) binary caches as infrastructure-as-code. Cachix is a hosted binary cache service for Nix that allows you to share build artifacts across machines and CI/CD pipelines.

## Example Usage

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
export CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

### Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "cachix" {
  auth_token = var.cachix_token
}
```
